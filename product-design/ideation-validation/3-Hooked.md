[Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked)

* How do products engage users?
* How do we build products and services to keep people coming back?
* Every business that forms a habit needs a hook
* The pattern **The hook model**

## The hook model

Trigger -> Action -> Reward -> Investment

* **Trigger** prompts the habit. We have two types of triggers:
    * **External triggers** are things in our environment that tell us what to do next. They give us a piece of information. Ex: Click here, Buy now, A friend telling you this is great...
    * **Internal triggers** are things that prompt us to action like a place, a situation, a routine, a certain person and most frequently, emotions that prompt us to do this next action without any explicit information.

* **Action** is the habit itself. Open an app, scroll through pinterest, search on google... They're actions that we do with little or no conscious thought that are these very simple behaviors that we do seeking a reward
* **Reward** is where the user's itch is scratched. Where they get what they came for and yet there's a bit of mystery around what they might find next time they engage with the product. Habit-forming technologies integrate what's called the variable reward
* **Investment** is where the user is prompted to put something into the product, to invest in the product in anticipation of a future benefit. The purpose is to increase the likelihood of the next pass. Two ways:
    * Investments load the next trigger. When I send someone a message on WhatsApp I don't get any immediate rewards I'm loading the next trigger because I'm likely to get a reply and the reply comes coupled with a external trigger "Hey here's a message from your friend" which prompts the user to use the hook once again
    * Investments store value. Storing value is when the product gets better and better with use, it appreciates in value. It does this by storing data, followers, reputation, content... Anything that I'm putting into the app that gets better and better over time.
