# Mindset

* Rework the definition of **failure**. Understand that pivoting, switching, changing things because the idea we have doesn't work in the real world is not a failure. The process is more about discovering and experiencing what works and what doesn't work and iterate it until we build something useful for our users.
* **Resilience** to be able to bounce back after something doesn't go your way and get comfortable hearing the word no.
* **Willingness to step outside** of whatever the room it is that you're in. Coming from an engineering background the "easy" and fun part is writing code, building something. But it's never is never useful to do until you have to build real understanding of what the customer wants.
